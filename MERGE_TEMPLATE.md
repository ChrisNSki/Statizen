- [ ] Documentation update

## Key Features Added

### üéÆ Level Progression System
- **XP Calculation**: Combined PVE and PVP XP for unified progression

- **Improved Death Detection**: Better classification of crash deaths and environmental hazards
- **Vehicle State Tracking**: Proper detection of ship entry/exit for accurate combat reporting

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Log Processing**: Improved regex patterns for better event detection
- **Automatic Data Migration**: Calculates XP from existing kill data on app startup
- **Robust Error Handling**: Better error handling and debug logging throughout
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficient data loading and state management

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are additive and maintain backward compatibility. Existing user data will be automatically migrated with XP calculation from kill history.

## Migration Notes

- Existing users will have XP automatically calculated from their kill history on first launch
- New users will start with 0 XP and accumulate normally
- All existing settings and data structures remain compatible
- Discord webhook behavior is unchanged unless "Include Level Data" is enabled

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact from additional calculations
- Automatic XP calculation runs once on startup for existing users
- Enhanced log processing maintains efficient event detection
- No significant memory or CPU overhead from new features
